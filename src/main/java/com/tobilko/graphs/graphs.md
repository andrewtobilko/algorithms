### Graphs

**Graph** is a set of vertices [notes, points] in which some pairs are wired by edges [arcs, lines].
**Path** is a sequence of vertices and edges that depicts hopping along graph

**Types of graphs:**

- directed
- undirected
- weighted (the weight is assigned to each edge)

**Adjacency matrices:**

 - [+] math representation
 - [+] fast to get edges
 - [+] fast to add/remove edges
 - [-] slow to add/remove vertices
 - [+] requires a lot of memory
