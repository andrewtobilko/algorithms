A graph is an ADT which is a set of vertices/nodes related by edges/arcs/lines.

Graph representations:

1. adjacency matrix

    - math representation
    - fast to check/add/remove edges
    - slow to add/remove vertices
    - requires a lot of memory

2. adjacency list

    - easy to add/remove vertices/edges
    - uses a lot less memory

Neighbors: adjacent vertices.  
In degree: a number of incoming edges.  
Out degree: a number of outgoing edges.
